    Compute the average MSSIM (Mean Structural Similarity Index) over a batch of images.

    This function assumes predictions and targets are PyTorch tensors with shape (B, C, H, W),
    where B is the batch size, C is the number of channels (e.g., spectral bands), and H and W are spatial dimensions.
    It converts each image pair to NumPy and computes MSSIM per sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    predictions : torch.Tensor
        Predicted images, shape (B, C, H, W), values should be float tensors (not integers).

    targets : torch.Tensor
        Ground truth images, same shape as `predictions`.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The average MSSIM score across the batch.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If input tensors do not have the same shape or are not 4D tensors.

def MSSIM(img1: np.ndarray, img2: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Compute the Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) between two hyperspectral images.

    This function supports both grayscale and multi-channel (e.g., RGB or hyperspectral) images.
    Images are automatically normalized to the range [0, 1] before computing SSIM.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    img1 : np.ndarray
        First image, with shape (H, W) for grayscale or (H, W, C) for multi-channel/hyperspectral.

    img2 : np.ndarray
        Second image, same shape as `img1`.

    Returns:
    -------
    float
        The average SSIM score across all channels. If input is grayscale, this is the standard SSIM.

    Raises:
    ------
    AssertionError:
        If the shapes of the two input images do not match.

    Notes:
    ------
    - Hyperspectral images typically have many channels, and MSSIM provides a single scalar score
      by averaging SSIM over all spectral bands.
    - Internally uses `skimage.metrics.structural_similarity` for each channel.
